# 🚕 Public Transport & Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes public transport traffic patterns using real-world NYC Taxi Trip data. 
The goal is to identify peak travel hours, trip duration trends, and revenue patterns to support 
data-driven urban planning and traffic optimization.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – NYC Taxi Trip Data
- Size: Large-scale real-world transportation dataset
- Features include pickup time, drop-off time, trip distance, fare amount, and passenger count.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed missing and invalid values
- Converted datetime columns to proper format
- Removed outliers in trip duration and fare amount
- Ensured data consistency for analysis

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Peak ride hours and daily traffic trends
- Trip duration distribution
- Revenue trends across time
- Passenger count analysis

## 📊 Visualizations
- Hourly traffic volume
- Trip duration distribution
- Revenue trend analysis
- Passenger count patterns

## 💡 Insights & Findings
- Peak demand observed during morning and evening rush hours
- Short-distance trips dominate city transport
- Revenue peaks align with high traffic periods
- Weekdays show higher traffic than weekends

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## 🚀 How to Run
